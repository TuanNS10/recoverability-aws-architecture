1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
    - Problem happens (First minute)
    - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 mins)
    - Automatically switch to second availability zone (1 mins)
    To summarize, it can take minimum ±10 mins
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
    - Problem happens (First minute)
    - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 mins)
    - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 mins)
    - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to a computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 mins)
    - On-call staff starts diagnosing the issue (10 mins)
    - Root cause is discovered (10 mins)
    - Remediation started (10 mins)
    - Issue fixed (5 mins)
    To summarize, it can take minimum ±60 mins for RTO
3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
    RDS has point in time restore available which uploads transactions every 5 minutes. Thus, if this is case then the most data that would be lost would be 5 minutes.
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
    Read replicas aim to be kept up to date with the primary DB so the read replica should have almost the same RPO as the primary DB.
    During initial setup and installation time, it takes minimum 15-20 minutes for system to get into Available state.
    Considering this, minimum RPO for single region outage is around 15 minutes.
